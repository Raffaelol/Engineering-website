          This week I learned about the different types of engineering. The one that sticked out to me was chemical engineering, because I it involves microscopic engineering which is fascinating. At the end of the week we started planning the Rube Goldberg Simple Machine. I also tried to realisticly model a wafflemaker in Tinkercad on Thursday.
