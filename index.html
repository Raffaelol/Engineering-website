          This week I learned about the different types of engineering. The one that sticked out to me was chemical engineering, because I it involves microscopic engineering which is fascinating. At the end of the week we started planning the Rube Goldberg Simple Machine. I also tried to realisticly model a wafflemaker in Tinkercad on Thursday.

          This week we mostly worked on our Rube Golberg design. Our team worked with cardboard, cutting out the shapes to make the objects which are used in the design itself. On Thursday we made a paper boat and put 8 quarters in it. Unfortunately, it did not do great on water.
