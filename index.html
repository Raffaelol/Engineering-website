          This week I learned about the different types of engineering. The one that sticked out to me was chemical engineering, because I it involves microscopic engineering which is fascinating. At the end of the week we started planning the Rube Goldberg Simple Machine. I also tried to realisticly model a wafflemaker in Tinkercad on Thursday.

          This week we mostly worked on our Rube Golberg design. Our team worked with cardboard, cutting out the shapes to make the objects which are used in the design itself. On Thursday we made a paper boat and put 8 quarters in it. Unfortunately, it did not do great on water.

          This was the week of actually bulding the Rube Goldberg design. We used our individual designs to make a design for the group whcih included elements from the every individual design. The process of building was tough and the time was scarce. On the final day we did not have a working Rube Goldberg design untl the last minute of the class. However, even now it took multiple tries to acutally pop the balloon. It took so many tries that the TA did not even record the successful trial, as he already got exhausted from recording all the previous failures.

          This we we did not much, because Mr. Poole was absent due to his Covid. We made a tinkercad for a limb prosthetic for an animal. I chose a fish and made a prosthetic for its tail.

        We started a new project this week. We are going to build a rocket out of a bottle. We have already designed the overall image of it on TinkerCad. It looks pretty simple but we hope it will work.

            This week we learned about bioengineering. This type of engineering uses technology to alter the enviorment making beneficial changes both to humans and nature. We used sand, rocks, and cotton to clean a very dirty water. My improvised filter did not do a very good job.

        This week we began learning about circuits. We learned the Ohm's law which states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. The formula is V=IR, where V is the voltage, I is the current, and R is the resistence. We designed a couple of cicuits on TinkerCad using LEDs.

            We started working on actual circuts and completed a couple of designs. We mainly used LEDs and resistors to create both direct and parallel structures. Also, we had an interesting debating challenge that required to argue which is better: to write down every number between 1 and 1,000,000 or take a math class. Me and my partner chose to advocate for the superiority of math.

        This week was intense. We got into programming a circuit, which was very interesting. We made the the LEDs light up with certain patterns as well as fade in and out. The challenge for this week tied back to Environmental Engineering couple of weeks ago. The objective was compelling, see the PDF attached. Over the thanksgiving break I intend to get really good sleep and work on my physics skills. I desperately need to extend my knowledge in physics. Other than that I will just be chilling with my family and freinds.

        We started our final project this week. It is an interesting and difficult assignment which is connected to Civil Engineering, bulding a spaghetti bridge. And it is even more complicated because of the condition that limits the allowed amount of spaghetti to only 20. During the first week, my group managed to make a design and build it, however it collapsed so quickly that we did not even have time to take some pictures. Below is the cad of our new design which we are hoping to build today.

           We dedicated this week to building the second design. We worked hard as the X's required pretty meticiulousness. We finally finished it at the end of the week. We are planning to test it next week.

           Our wonderful design broke without showing any fight. We saved the body of it, removed the arches and added reinforcement on the sides. The full chronology can be found on our presentation below.
